## Support

You may need help at different stages of this unit.
The most effective way to get the help you need is to:

1. Check unit website/handsout/slides.
2. Ask your question on the Unit Teams Group
3. Contact one of the lecturers

## Course Structure

Every week, you are expected to watch the videos and do the exercise sheet before the Q&A session.
Q&A sessions should be used to ask questions about the material seen in videos and the exercise sheets.
The lab cover material seen in the previous week lecture (e.g. Lab 1 covers material from Week 1, Lab 2 from week 2 etc.).
Questions about the lab should be asked during the lab sessions.
Any part of this unit can be examined.

## Reading Material

As part of the unit, you will be referred to chapter in books to read.
We give full reference bellow.

- [OS part] Doeppner, Thomas W., **Operating Systems in Depth** (Wiley, 2010) ISBN 978-0-471-68723-8

- [Security part] Michael Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia, Brown University, "**Introduction to Computer Security**, Pearson New International Edition, 2014.

**NOTE:** The security book is available in eBook format from the [library catalogue](http://www.bris.ac.uk/library/) by running a quick author/title search. **Imp:** If you download a copy on your device then it takes one of the copies out of circulation for a time so I encourage you to read what you need online and then exit the book that would be great as that way it will move around the class better. Please get in touch with the library staff if access to the book is getting difficult.
